<h2>TRANS MANAGER</h2>

<p>The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly freight shipment planning web application which uses Google tools to enhance the quality of the daily business for logistic companies the application is built for and make it more comfortable for employees to perform their daily tasks.</p>
<p>The Google tools I used here are Google Maps and Google Calendar. Google Maps is used to show the planned route for each cargo shipment. However, Google calendar allows to see all the web application's shipment data on any device that can use the this calendar.</p>    
<p>The application is developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL. For more efficient development process laravel framework also is used.</p>
<p>Additional feature planned to be implemented is Google Drive where it would be possible to save transport documents for each shipment. </p>
